Ecommerce Website Built with Next.js, Sanity, NextAuth, MUI, and Prisma
This repository contains the code for an ecommerce website built using modern web development technologies. The website is built with Next.js, a popular React-based framework for building server-side rendered applications.

For data management, Sanity CMS is used to store and manage the content of the website. NextAuth provides user authentication, authorization, and session management. Material-UI (MUI) is used as the component library for the website's UI.

Prisma is used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for this ecommerce application. It provides an easy way to interact with the database and provides a type-safe API for database queries.

This ecommerce website features a user-friendly interface with a responsive design, making it accessible on any device. Users can browse products, add items to their cart, and complete the checkout process.
